<h4>Hi we are a startup team to create a new traveling app</h4>

<p>Long before trip-advisor and google maps became a thing, travelling overseas was an adventure - </br>
    what lies ahead in our destination remains a mystery for us to uncover. Yet with so much information</br>
    available on the internet today, we tend to over-plan our travel itinerary with the 'fear of missing out'</br>
    certain places. The refreshing excitement of discovery is thus lost. We want to bring that excitement</br>
    of unplanned uncovering of points of interests back into modern travel with ExplorR.</p>

<p>You will like what we are doing if you are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an indepandent solo traveler who are not paying high prenium tour agency fee</li>
        <li>an adventurer who are tired of planned itinerary and want more spontaneity</li>
        <li>an explorer who are looking to find the hidden gems in the city </li>
    </ul>
<p>We are designing our product to meet your needs</p>
    <ol>
        <li>End to end experience design to faciliate trip planning,POIs discovery and navigation</li>
        <li>Curated Point of interests and co-created by the community</li>

    </ol>
